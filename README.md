# Elysium Fix (Windows)

A lightweight local manager app for a Windows service build. ✅

## 📦 What’s inside
- `elysium-fix.exe` — the manager app
- `new/` — required runtime files and presets
- `*.dll` — required runtime dependencies

## ✅ Quick start
1. Download and extract the folder (keep all files together).
2. Run `elysium-fix.exe`.
3. If you use install/remove service actions, run the app as Administrator.

## ⚠️ Important
- Keep the `new` folder next to `elysium-fix.exe`.
- Don’t rename or move files inside `new` unless you know what you’re doing.

## 🧩 Tips
- If the app doesn’t start, try right‑click → Run as administrator.
- If the UI looks empty, check that `new` exists next to the EXE.

## 💬 Support
If something doesn’t work, share a screenshot + the log area.
